# Project title:
## Cocktails together :cocktail:

## Project description🚀:
_In this project I have developed a cocktail search engine, whose function is to search among more than 635 cocktails and have the possibility of adding them to a list of favourites._

## A website will be developed with the following characteristics:
Language: English.
Using HTML, Sass and Javascript.   
Use of mediaqueries and other responsive design techniques so that the website adapts to the screen size of different devices, although it is designed for tablet use onwards.  
Using git for project version control.  
Use of branches to make distinct parts.  
Use of pull request to merge branches into the main branch.  
Publication of the result on the Internet using GitHub Pages. 

### On the main page, you will see:

* A header: company name, icon and slogan.
* Main: search engine with a button to start the search and a second button to reset the data.
